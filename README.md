# Bank Marketing Campaign Dataset Cleaning

## Project Description

Data cleaning is an essential skill for data engineers, involving tasks such as reading, modifying, splitting, and storing data. In this project, I focused on processing a bank marketing campaign dataset. The objective was to clean and reformat the data, creating multiple CSV files that are easier to work with for further analysis.

In this notebook, I applied data-cleaning techniques to a dataset concerning marketing campaigns run by a bank. The process included modifying values, adding new features, converting data types, and saving the cleaned data into multiple files.

## Project Instructions

1. ### Subset, Clean, and Reformat:
   - I split the `bank_marketing.csv` dataset into three subsets: `client`, `campaign`, and `economics`.
   - Each subset was formatted according to specific requirements, including data type conversions and value modifications.

2. ### Save DataFrames:
   - I saved the cleaned DataFrames to CSV files without an index. The files are named `client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv`.

## Files

- `client.csv`: Contains the cleaned client data.
- `campaign.csv`: Contains the cleaned campaign data.
- `economics.csv`: Contains the cleaned economic data.
